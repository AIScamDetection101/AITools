## The Rise of Investment Scams in the Digital Age

With the rapid advancement of online trading and investment platforms, fraudulent schemes have multiplied at an alarming rate. Common investment scams include:

1. **Ponzi and Pyramid Schemes** – Fraudulent businesses that promise high returns but pay early investors using new investors' money.
2. **Fake Forex and Cryptocurrency Brokers** – Scam platforms that lure traders with attractive promises but never process withdrawals.
3. **Phishing Scams** – Fraudsters impersonate legitimate investment firms to steal sensitive information.
4. **Pump-and-Dump Schemes** – Scammers artificially inflate asset prices before selling them at a profit, leaving investors with worthless stocks or cryptocurrencies.

Many of these scams are difficult to identify, as fraudsters use convincing tactics to appear legitimate. This is where AI-powered scam detection tools become essential.
